## Compacity Block
This font is heavily inspired by (dotsies)[https://dotsies.org/] and i wanted to mess around with the idea and create something useable for me, it's still pretty experimental but you can't deny that it looks really cool

### How It Works
So there are 6 black squares in a thin line and they are used as binary 1's and 0's\
The line in the middle is used as an anchor so you know where the middle is and so you have to figure out only the 3 squares on both sides of the line\
This also allows compacting the writing vertically as the line is always in the middle, while unintentionally it also serves to connect the sentences as `.` and `,` are big spaces without the line

### Goal
I want to learn to read it at least close to speed regular old latin and see if it is really possible, of course my layout won't work for everyone so i will make it easy to change the layout for yourself if you want to

## Building The Font
